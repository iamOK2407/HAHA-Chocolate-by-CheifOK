Add cup of cold pressed coconut oil in a cold saucepan. Immediately add honey. Whisk it for about 10 seconds just to get the honey mixed. Now, add of Natural Unsweetened Cocoa powder. Rigorously whisk it for another 10 seconds. Make sure that the flame is at its lowest throughout the whole process. The glossy mixture formed should neither be runny nor thick, just the pouring consistency. Pour it in your favorite mould or any container and refrigerate for a few hours. That's all. Enjoy rich homemade dark chocolate.

CAUTION - Avoid overheating the cocoa powder. The total process will hardly take a minute or two.
